## Contributor License Compromise

Independent contributions (i.e. individual pull requests) from anyone other than the Weird team ([Erlend Sogge Heggen](https://github.com/erlend-sh/), [Kapono Haws](https://github.com/zicklag/) & [Joe](https://github.com/hnb-ku)) are dual-licensed as [Polyform NonCommercial](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/) - granted to Weird as the _licensor_ - and [Blue Oak Model License v1.0](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0) (which is [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/license/blue-oak-model-license)).

Meaning, all independent contributors retain ownership of their own contributions, albeit non-exclusively. In other words, your contributions belong equally to the Weird project as they do to you.

## Q&A

#### Why the PolyForm NonCommercial license?

Because Weird wants to serve self-hosters and cloud-subscribers on equal terms. As product developers we believe 'you become what you sell', and we want first and foremost to be software providers, not cloud providers. (Expounding blog post TBA).

#### Why the Blue Oak license for contributors and general utilities?

Blue Oak is a simpler and [more modern alternative](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/03/09/Deprecation-Notice.html) to older permissive licenses with equivalent legal implications.
